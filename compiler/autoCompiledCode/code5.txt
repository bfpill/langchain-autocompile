I will use the following code:

```
import math

# Define gravitational constant
G = 6.6743e-11

# Define masses and distance between objects
mass1 = 5000
mass2 = 10000
distance = 100

# Calculate gravitational force
force = G * mass1 * mass2 / math.pow(distance, 2)

# Print the result
print("Gravitational force:", force)
```
